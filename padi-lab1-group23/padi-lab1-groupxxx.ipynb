You will start by loading the transition probability matrix from a `numpy` binary file, using the `numpy` function `load`. You will then consider the state space to consist of all valid indices for the loaded transition matrix, each represented as a string. For example, if the transition probability matrix is $20\\times 20$, the states should include the strings `'0'` to `'19'`."

    "Using the analytical approach, we determined that StopITSpider02 with P['go'] = 1 is the fastest chain. This conclusion is based on the fact that it spends the most time in goal states according to the stationary distribution and, as expected, has the fewest expected steps to reach a goal state.\n",
    "From the results, we observe that for StopITSpider02, reducing γγ from 1 to 0.75 decreases the time spent in goal states (from 0.1249 to 0.1105) and increases the expected steps (from 8.00 to 9.05), indicating a slower convergence to the goal.\n",
    "On the other hand, we observe the reverse pattern for StopITSpider04: decreasing γ γ decreases the predicted steps (from 16.18 to 14.22) and increases the time spent in goal states (from 0.0618 to 0.0703), indicating that a different action selection technique is more effective in this context.\n",
    "Given that a single fixed method does not work optimally in all circumstances, these findings support the idea that the optimal probability for action selection should be modified when the likelihood of wet days varies.\n",
